Create an Applet which displays a message in the center of the screen. The message indicates
the events taking place on the applet window. Handle events like mouse click, mouse moved,
mouse dragged, mouse pressed, and key pressed. The message should update each time an event
occurs. The message should give details of the event such as which mouse button was pressed,
which key is pressed etc. (Hint: Use repaint(), KeyListener, MouseListener, MouseEvent method
getButton, KeyEvent methods getKeyChar)
