Write a program to accept a string as command line argument and check whether it is a file or
directory. If it is a directory, list the contents of the directory, count how many files the
directory has and delete all files in that directory having extension .txt. (Ask the user if the
files have to be deleted). If it is a file, display all information about the file (path, size,
attributes etc).
