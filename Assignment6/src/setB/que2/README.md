# Que2

Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations on a set of integers. The
Load operation should generate 50 random integers (2 digits) and display the numbers on the
screen. The save operation should save the numbers to a file numbers.txt. The Compute menu
provides various operations and the result is displayed in a message box. The Search operation
accepts a number from the user in an input dialog and displays the search result in a message
dialog. The sort operation sorts the numbers and displays the sorted data on the screen.
